# C++ Experience
Repository showcasing my experience with C++

## What I learned
This repository contains my work for all of my assignments where I had to code using C++ using features such as friend classes and friend methods, generics and template classes, UML diagrams such as Sequence diagrams or State Transition diagrams, implementing design patterns into my code such as Singleton, Oberserver, Decorator, and more.

I learned about plenty of concepts and features used in C++ such as multiple inheritance, friend classes and methods, templates, abstract and pure abstract functions and classes, visibilities, overloading operators and copy constructors, how constructors and destructors work, and much more.
